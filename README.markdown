CoatOrNot?
============

CoatOrNot is a small webapp written in Ruby using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

"Quick and dirty" is an appropriate expression to describe the development process.

I just wanted to create a simple application and deploy it really fast. It's hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), a service I strongly recommend.
